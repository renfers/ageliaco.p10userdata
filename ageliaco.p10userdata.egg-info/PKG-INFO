Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This product adds some properties to the user data to exploit to its best the values
        there are in the p10 ldap.
        
        This product is dependant on **plone.app.ldap**, because it does set the basic properties.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
          * Go to admin > Site Setup > Add-ons
          * Activate plone.app.ldap
          * Activate ageliaco.p10userdata
          * Go to ZMI > acl_users > ldap-plugin > acl_users
            ** reset LDAP Server
            ** reset "Configure" to fit your needs (filter and groups)
        
        There is a bug concerning plone.app.ldap => when the ldap server is set 
        it doesn't set properly the port number, and the ldap filter is not set either.
        
        This product may contain traces of nuts.
